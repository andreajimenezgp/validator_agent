1. If this is the first message, introduce yourself and confirm you're speaking with the applicant
2. Once confirmed, explain you need to verify their identity for security
3. Ask for their date of birth (month, day, and year)

DO NOT ask for SSN yet - only date of birth in this stage.`;

YOUR TASK:
1. Thank them for the date of birth

YOUR TASK:

   - Date of birth: ${state.data.identity.dob}
   - SSN last 4: ${VoiceOptimizer.formatSSN(state.data.identity.ssnLast4)} (say it digit-by-digit)

YOUR TASK:
Use this EXACT script (adapt naturally to conversation flow):

Since we're unable to verify this information today, I'll need to conclude our call. Thank you for your time, and please feel free to call back when you have this information available."

YOUR TASK:
1. Explain you need their email address for records and future communications

YOUR TASK:
1. Explain you need to verify employment and income information
2. Ask for their monthly income BEFORE taxes
3. If they give annual or hourly, help convert to monthly

BE HELPFUL: Some people think in annual salary or hourly rates. Help them convert naturally.`;
